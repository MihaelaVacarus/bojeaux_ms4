### **Design** ###

#### **Wireframes** ####
The wireframes for the website have been created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and are available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/TxA1czx6sYCXVmdOcjD8g2/MS4?node-id=0%3A1).Tablet and mobile devices share the same layout, while a separate design has been created for the desktop views. 

#### **Data models and schemas** ####

Fixtures JSON files have been created and used to easily upload the products information into the database.



#### **Fonts** ####
Noto Sans KR font with a Sans Serif fallback has been chosen for the entire website.

#### **Colors and branding** ####
Black, grey and white are the main colors chosen for the brand, click [here](https://coolors.co/ffffff-eae9ec-000000) to see the palette.

According to La Reserve Magazine's [article](https://www.lareserve-mag.com/the-colors-of-luxury/) reflecting on the colors of luxury, choosing one iconic color and consistently using it throughout the products is key in communicating a strong high-end brand identity. In upscale fashion, black is timeless and looks sophisticated, just like explained in this [article](https://brandingcompass.com/branding/color-theory-black-as-a-branding-color/) by branding compass. Finally, pearly gray, similar to Dior's signature shade, is chic, modern and easily allows for incorporating more colors.
