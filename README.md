View the live project [here](https://bojeaux-ms4.herokuapp.com/).

Bojeaux is a fictitious luxury beauty brand focused on hair, face and body products. Designed as my final project for Code Instituteâ€™s program, the main goal is to present a fully functional e-commerce site using Django and Stripe payments integration.

### **Design** ###

#### **Wireframes** ####
The wireframes for the website have been created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and are available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/TxA1czx6sYCXVmdOcjD8g2/MS4?node-id=0%3A1).Tablet and mobile devices share the same layout, while a separate design has been created for the desktop views. 

#### **Information Architecture** ####

Fixtures JSON files have been created and used to easily upload the products information into the database.
I have used SQLite for the development process and PostgreSQL for the deployed site. Static and media files are hosted in a AWS S3 bucket.
The project consists of eight Django apps:

- Bojeaux
- Home - displays home, about, ToU, privacy policy and FAQ pages
- Bag - displays the bag views and handles CRUD operations
- Products
    - Product Model - stores information on each product
    ```
    category = models.ForeignKey('Category', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    description = models.TextField(max_length=1000)
    ingredients = models.TextField(max_length=500)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True)
    ```
    - Category Model - stores the product categories
    ```
    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)

    order_total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=False, default=0)
    grand_total = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=False, default=0)

    stripe_pid = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=False, blank=False, default='')
    ```
    - OrderLineItem - stores information on products in an order
    ```
    order = models.ForeignKey(Order, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='lineitems')
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    quantity = models.IntegerField(null=False, blank=False, default=0)

    ```
- Blog 
    - Blog Model - stores information on each blog post
    ```

    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200, unique=True)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=40, null=True, blank=True)
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    ```
- Profiles 
    - UserProfile Model - stores information on each user profile

    default_postcode = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)
    default_country = CountryField(blank_label='Country', null=True, blank=True)
    ```
- Wishlist - stores information on user's wishlist
    - Wishlist Model
    ```
    user_profile = models.ForeignKey('profiles.UserProfile', on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=False, blank=False, related_name='wishlist')
    products = models.ManyToManyField('products.Product')
    ```
#### **Fonts** ####
Noto Sans KR font with a Sans Serif fallback has been chosen for the entire website.

#### **Colors and branding** ####
Black, grey and white are the main colors chosen for the brand, click [here](https://coolors.co/ffffff-eae9ec-000000) to see the palette.

According to La Reserve Magazine's [article](https://www.lareserve-mag.com/the-colors-of-luxury/) reflecting on the colors of luxury, choosing one iconic color and consistently using it throughout the products is key in communicating a strong high-end brand identity. In upscale fashion, black is timeless and looks sophisticated, just like explained in this [article](https://brandingcompass.com/branding/color-theory-black-as-a-branding-color/) by branding compass. Finally, pearly gray, similar to Dior's signature shade, is chic, modern and easily allows for incorporating more colors.
