### [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
Run on all pages and passed with no errors/warnings.


### [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
Run on CSS code and no errors returned, just a few warnings that relate to browser prefixes and that can be safely ignored.

### [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html)
Run the Python code validator and fixed most issues. The unfixed ones I researched and learned it's fine to leave as they are.
